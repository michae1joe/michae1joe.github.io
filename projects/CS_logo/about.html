<h1>About the Project </h1>

<p><img src="../CS_logo/images/profile picture-06.png" alt="Profile Picture" width="400"></p>

<p>This logo was made for Clean shorts Film Festival. A first year program for Digital Cinema Students at Moore Norman Technology center. I was a part of there Graphic Design program where we would collab with Digital Cinema for varios projects. This project never came to be finished because it was made at the end of the school year when things were wrapping up. It was still a good peice of work worth showing and the collab was fun. </p>

<p>Today I still do Graphic Design and apply my skills to varios areas in the design feild.</p>
