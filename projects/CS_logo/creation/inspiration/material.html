<h1>The Insparation and Materials Used</h1>

<p>The outline of the project was to create a logo celebrating the 10th anniversiary of the Clean Shorts Film Festival. The first year teacher from the Digital Cinema program approached us with this idea, where we would create a Facebook icon and banner, a poster, and a T-Shirt design. He wanted to feature a retro design.
<br>
To find insparation, I went through different generations of cameras. I found a camera that looked similar to the one my parents used for home videos. I went and found the camera and deciced to use it as a reference.

<br>
Going off of this I gathered other film references, like tape to have other elements in the design.

Then I decided to take inspiration from the recording interface, and the camera menu for the poster format. I thought the idea of 2000's home videoes was personal, and tied into students making videos.
