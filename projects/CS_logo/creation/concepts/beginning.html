<h1>Starting the Process</h1>

<p>After finding the camera and getting references I went right to work on the logo. It required that I would make a poster, a Facebook icon and banner, and a T-Shirt design with the logo. 
<br>
I started off on a program called Ibis Paint to create the statc/airbrush look of the camera. I made a couple iterations staring from making it look realistic to having it just be a spray painted stencil.

<br>
Next I modified the logo. When doing this I made sure to get permission to not only change the colors but warp the shape of the logo. Its important to get permission for that because companies may have specific rules on how their logo should be presented. Here I ended up with a couple of options to use for the design and icon.

After these and a few more concepts the design started to come together.
