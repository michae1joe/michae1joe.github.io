        This is set to be the third film installment of the Tron series. There is not much information about this movie out right now. The information we do have is that the story will follow a program, Ares, who is sent to the human world. The score this time will be written by Nine Inch Nails, as Daft Punk split in 2021. It will be interesting to see how they continue this series visually, musically and story wise. </div>
