    <h1>Soundtrack</h1> 
    
    <div id="p1">The music of Tron.
        <br> The music is one of the most important elements of this franchise. Tron Legacy's score was written by Daft Punk, and featured Electronica mixed with a live orchestra. They created one of the most unique and strong movie scores of its time. People like myself remembered the soundtrack before the movie.

    <div id="p2">For Ares, the soundtrack will be done by Nine Inch Nails. It will be interesting to see how their style and experience will affect this movie. </div>
