    TRON, 1982
<br>One of the most unique films of its time. They took the concept of “what would it look like to be inside a computer?” and went with it. This film did a great job of indirectly communicating to the audience the internal processes of a computer. Tron was one of the first films to utilize CGI. The actual amount of time for the CGI scenes was under 20 minutes. It took over a year for them to make that. The one area where this movie really lacked is the plot. It was hard to follow and not very well written. </div>
    
    <div id="p2">TRON: Legacy, 2010
        <br>The successor of the first movie would have a much more well rounded story to tell. Despite the improvement, Tron is still not really known for having the best storytelling. It has one of the best movie scores hands down. The music for the movie was written by Daft Punk and features an orchestra blended with electronica. The visuals for this film went through a big upgrade. The CGI in this film was also good. The only thing that seems rough looking at it now is the CGI used to de-age Flynn’s face for CLU. The redesigns for this modern version are stunning though. The ships and motorcycles feel real and powerful. It’s so different and completely immerses you in the world of Tron.
